1.selenium.common.exceptions.StaleElementReferenceException: Message:stale element reference: element is not attached to the page document
  [worked for first two usernames and then this error]
  What I did?
  updated self.message again before adding it to the text area.
  Possible Reason of error: Since the DOM has changed e.g. through the update action, you are receiving a StaleElementReference Error.
